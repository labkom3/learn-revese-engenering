## IPv4 and IPv6

### IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) inet

Address Format: IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numbers, typically represented in decimal format as four octets (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
Address Space: It supports approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses, which has become insufficient due to the growth of the internet.
Features: IPv4 includes features like fragmentation, checksum, and support for both connection-oriented and connectionless communication.

#### IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) inet6

Address Format: IPv6 addresses are 128-bit numbers, represented in hexadecimal format (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
Address Space: It supports a vastly larger address space (about 3.4×10^38 addresses), solving the exhaustion problem of IPv4.
Features: IPv6 simplifies address assignment, improves routing efficiency, and includes built-in security features (IPsec).

### NAT (Network Address Translation)

Purpose: NAT is used to conserve IPv4 addresses and enhance security. It allows multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address.

How It Works:
Translation: When a device on a private network (e.g., 192.168.1.2) sends a request to the internet, NAT translates its private IP address to the public IP address of the router.

Mapping: NAT maintains a mapping table to keep track of which internal IP address corresponds to which external request.
Response Handling: When a response comes back to the public IP, NAT uses the mapping table to forward the response to the correct internal device.

Summary
IPv4 is limited in address space, while IPv6 provides a much larger address pool.
NAT helps manage the limited IPv4 addresses by allowing multiple devices to share a single public IP, enhancing security and conserving address space.

### TCP and UDP

**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):**

- Connection-oriented protocol with reliable, ordered, error-checked delivery
- Guarantees data arrival through acknowledgement, retransmission, and flow control
- Uses sequence numbers for correct reassembly
- Used for: web browsing, email, file transfer, remote login

**UDP (User Datagram Protocol):**

- Connectionless protocol, lightweight and simple
- No delivery guarantee; tolerates data loss
- No acknowledgement or retransmission
- Used for: streaming media, online gaming, DNS, VoIP

**TCP Three-Way Handshake:**

1. **SYN**: Client sends SYN packet with initial sequence number
2. **SYN-ACK**: Server responds with SYN and ACK flags, includes its sequence number
3. **ACK**: Client sends ACK packet, confirming connection established

**Summary:**

TCP provides reliable, ordered delivery for applications requiring guaranteed transmission. UDP offers speed and efficiency for real-time applications that can tolerate packet loss.
