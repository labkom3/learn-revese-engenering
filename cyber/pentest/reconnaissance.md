# Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)

## What is reconnaissance?

Reconnaissance is the phase of a security assessment or attack where an actor collects information about a target to understand its attack surface, technologies, people, and public footprint. It is about reducing uncertainty: what exists, how it's connected, and where weaknesses may lie.

## High‑level goals

- Build an inventory of assets (domains, IPs, services, web applications).
- Identify exposed services and entry points.
- Discover technologies, versions, and third‑party integrations.
- Collect contextual information (people, emails, org structure, public code).
- Assess what an attacker could learn without privileged access.

## Two broad approaches

- Passive reconnaissance: gathers information from public sources without interacting directly with the target (public websites, DNS records, search engines, social media, code repositories, archives ,building and activity). Low likelihood of detection.lastly don't forget using google advance search and social media

### discovering email

- hunter.io
- phonebook.cz
- voilanorbert.com
- clearbit (has to be crome)
- tools.verifyemailaddress.io
- email-checker.net/validate
- email connection ![alt text](<Screenshot 2025-12-08 160222.png>)

### gethering credential breach

- breach-parse (github hmaverickadam) use ./breach.sh @tesla.com tesla.txt  then gedit or nano
- dehashed and hashes.org for searching the hash

### hunting subdomain

- sublist3r (sudo apt install -> sublist3ter -d web.com)
- crt.sh
- owasp amass (github)
- tomnomnom httprobe (check if the web is live)

### website technologies

- builtwith.com
- Wappalyzer firefox addon (simple)
- whatweb <https://web.com>

### burp suite

- on target site map (in setting like css)

- Active reconnaissance: involves direct interaction with the target (service probes, banner grabbing, network scans). Provides fresher detail but may be logged or detected. Only perform with explicit authorization.

## Types of information commonly collected

- External identifiers: domains, subdomains, IP ranges, CDN usage.
- DNS and registration metadata (registrar, name servers, delegation).
- Network exposure: open ports, exposed services, hosted platforms.
- Application footprint: web frameworks, CMS, libraries, API endpoints.
- People and roles: employee names, emails, professional profiles.
- Public code and secrets (in repos or leak sites) — often critical.
- Historical data: archived sites, prior certificates, DNS history.
- Third‑party dependencies and integrations.

## Why it matters (defensive view)

- Early detection of what attackers can see helps prioritize controls.
- Reveals misconfigured assets or forgotten services.
- Informs threat modeling and incident response playbooks.
- Drives low‑cost mitigations (remove public secrets, close unused ports, tighten DNS records).

## Ethics, legality, and scope

- Always obtain explicit authorization (e.g., written scope for tests).
- Passive collection still has privacy and legal boundaries — respect policies and terms of services.
- Distinguish research/education from unauthorized probing.

## Detection and mitigation strategies

- Inventory and reduce public footprint (remove stale domains/subdomains).
- Enforce least-privilege on public artifacts (no secrets in repos).
- Harden DNS and registrar accounts (2FA, access controls).
- Use monitoring and logging to detect unusual discovery activity.
- Rate‑limit, apply CAPTCHAs, WAF rules, and anomaly detection on public interfaces.
- Employ honeypots to detect targeted reconnaissance.

## Useful frameworks and references

- OWASP resources on web application security.
- MITRE ATT&CK for mapping reconnaissance TTPs to detection/response.
- Publicly documented OSINT best practices and privacy guidelines.

## Gotchas / common mistakes

- Assuming passive data is stale — attackers combine passive and active methods.
- Ignoring third‑party exposures (vendors, cloud services, analytics).
- Overlooking historical or archived data that re‑reveals secrets.
- Treating reconnaissance as a one‑time task rather than continuous monitoring.

## Short checklist for an authorized assessment

- Define scope and rules of engagement.
- Enumerate public assets and ownership.
- Identify sensitive public content (credentials, PII).
- Map exposed services and technologies at a high level.
- Recommend quick mitigations and longer remediation work.
